### What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

### What do you think of static site generators?

I think they are dreadful to work with, at least I think Jekyll is. It is very difficult to set up as it is built on Ruby and not suitable for windows. In addition, has nothing to add compared to building a site yourself. It is not very flexible, and it is very easy to get lost in the structure of the site as well as figuring out how it works.

### What type of projects are they suitable for?

I can’t really see the use, but it might be suitable for someone who isn’t familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and can accept the limitations the tool offers. It could also be suitable if you are on a very regular basis setting up several similar pages with simple layout.

### What is robots.txt and how have you configured it for your site?

It is an exclusion standard or protocol used to communicate with crawlers and robots, giving guidance as to where they can or cannot go. It does not prevent malware and can be ignored. My Robot.txt file allows only google to crawl.

### What is humans.txt and how have you configured it for your site?

It’s a text file declaring the people participating in the creation of the site and giving some information about them. 
In my humans.txt file the Team behind the file consists of Jekyll and me. Technical support and guidance has been received from Johan and Mats who are mentioned in the “thanks”. The basic information about the site is describing last update, language, doctype and IDE.
