### What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

I think pre-compiled CSS is very useful and adds a great deal of benefits. It alleviates the work of styling a webpage by minimal repetition and improved maintainability.  By addressing the usage of variables, nesting and mixing it acts as a powerful tool allowing more advanced use of code for styling than seen in the traditional CSS. Re-usability will increase the productivity by decreasing the amount of code written, thus reducing the risk of faults.

### What do you think of static site generators?

I think they are dreadful to work with, at least I think Jekyll is. It is very difficult to set up as it is built on Ruby and not suitable for windows. In addition, has very little to add compared to building a site yourself. It is not very flexible, and it is very easy to get lost in the structure of the site as well as figuring out how it works.

### What type of projects are they suitable for?

It is useful for organizations or larger sites with frequent updates and changes. It is an appropriate tool for i.e. content creators who are responsible for regular changes and updates on a website. The static site generator can also act as a very useful tool for someone who isn’t familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and can accept the limitations the tool offers. 

### What is robots.txt and how have you configured it for your site?

It is an exclusion standard or protocol used to communicate with crawlers and robots, giving guidance as to where they can or cannot go. It does not prevent malware and can be ignored. My Robot.txt file allows only google to crawl.

### What is humans.txt and how have you configured it for your site?

It’s a text file declaring the people participating in the creation of the site and giving some information about them. 
In my humans.txt file the Team behind the file consists of Jekyll and me. Technical support and guidance has been received from Johan and Mats who are mentioned in the “thanks”. The basic information about the site is describing last update, language, doctype and IDE.
